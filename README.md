# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Brodie! I'm a full-stack developer with [futureproof](getfutureproof.co.uk) currently placed at [emerald works](https://emeraldworks.com/)!

I build webapps with a React/MUI frontend and a serverless backend (AWS Lambda) with event-driven architecture.

I'm passionate about tech, science, and investing - and I'm always looking to learn more!
